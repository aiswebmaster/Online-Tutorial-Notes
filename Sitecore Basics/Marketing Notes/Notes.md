## Types of Personalization

- Implicit
- Explicit

### Implicit

A type of personalization that involves changes that affect the user non forcefully, such as that which might take place via pages they've visited.

(Personas):

Start by determining the different types of users.. Example for Game Stop, you would have the Online Shopping, In-Person Shopper, Researcher, Job Seekers, Employees, etc.

Some Personas may use the website channel less than others.  So some personas, use social channels, email, print, calls

Then determine user role importance and priority based on importance or providing impact to the business, based on income or whatever is important to the business.  Because focusing on all users all at once leads to chaos.

Define Segments (Persona is a type of Segment)

Segment - Aligned Personas - Change Messaging

Regional - C Level (CFO, CIO, CEO) - Yes/No
Industy - Academic - Yes/No
Buying Cycle - C Level - Yes/No

Segment List: so for regional, would be America, India, etc.

#### Content Strategy

Once you have the personas defined, you need to map out the content that relates to those personas.  Also it would be a good idea to include a list of the type of content a site might have.  So for the Game Stop example, we would have Game Details, 

### Explicit

A type of personalization based on data we've directly collected from a user from a form or other collection method.
