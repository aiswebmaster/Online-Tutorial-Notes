Everything is in Core:

This is where the Speak Renderings (Out of the Box ones) live:

## Speak 2.0 Vs 1.1

Speak 2.0 Introduced in Sitecore 8.1

You cannot mix Sitecore Speak Versions, must be either 1 or 2.  To enable 2, you should open up the properties of the PageCode, and find the property called SpeakCoreVersion and change to Speak Core 2-0.
